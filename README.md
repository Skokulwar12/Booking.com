INTRODUCTION-

Welcome aboard! We're embarking on a data-driven expedition into the captivating world of hotel bookings. Armed with the powerful tool of SQL, we'll dissect a dataset overflowing with valuable information about guest behavior.  Our mission? To unearth hidden patterns, uncover intriguing trends, and understand how guests interact with the hospitality industry.

DATASET OVERVIEW-

This project centers around analyzing a dataset sourced from hotel booking records, encompassing details like booking dates, hotel information, guest demographics, and reservation statuses. Through the utilization of SQL queries and data analysis techniques, our objective is to address diverse inquiries and unveil valuable insights embedded within the dataset.

Analysis-
To guide our analysis, we formulated several key questions to explore and address using the dataset: 
1.	What is the overall cancellation rate for hotel bookings?
